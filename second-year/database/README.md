# SQL and NoSQL Database comparison

This is an assignment on the subject; Information Systems and Databases. In this assignment, 
Firebase Cloud Firestore is selected to be compared with SQL database.

## Firebase Cloud Firestore
According to Cloud Firestore documentation site, it is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web and 
server development from Google's Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Moreover, the Cloud Firestore
provides syncing functionality to client apps through real-time listeners and as well as offers offline support
for mobile and web apps.

In fact, Cloud Firestore is actually a service which allows developers to perform rapid application development.
Instead of an actual 3-tier application development, Cloud Firestore binds the server-sided service with database. So, 
developers could use Firestore as an API service in accessing data via either Firestore Client SDK or Firestore Admin SDK.  

## Get started with Cloud Firestore
When developing any application with Firestore, there are some few steps those are required as a prerequisite.
### 1. Create a Cloud Firestore project on Firebase console.
Since Firestore is one of Firebase products, developers have to create a Firebase project to use Firestore.
This can be done on [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com). 
### 2. Set up development environment
Firestore provides several SDK on many languages so developer may choose the one that they are familiar with.
But in this particular example, we'll illustrate the Firestore usage with a javascript SDK for web.
### 3. Initialize a Cloud Firestore instance.
